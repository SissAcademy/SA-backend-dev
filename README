1)Clone this repo to your local machine
2)Install dependencies
3)!IMPORTANT! create a database.js in app/config and fill it with required data.
3)Open CLI in the root directory of the project
4)Type there "npm run dev"

Make sure you have node.js installed.
Current node version v8.9.0

In order to install all dependencies without problem I recommend to install
$ npm install --global npm-install-que
Then use 'npm-install-que' command instead or 'npm install'
That will allow you to install all packages 1 by 1.
In the end there are might be some uninstalled packages left, you'll have to manually install them as usual.

I personally prefer to use Git Bash as CLI.
With it you can right click inside of directory and open CLI directly there.


To test stuff do some proxy:

Create a new user
method: Post
url: localhost:5001//users/create
data: {email,password, username}

Check users/routes for more requests
